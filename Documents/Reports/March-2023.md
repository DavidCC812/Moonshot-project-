# Report for step 1.5 of Machine Learning-powered Fraud Detection System for Healthcare

## Overview
For Step 1.5 of the project, I began building the machine learning model for insurance fraud detection in healthcare. Specifically, I started with the data preprocessing step, which involved cleaning and transforming the dataset to make it suitable for training and testing the model.

## Data Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for model training, I first removed any duplicate or irrelevant data, as well as any missing values. I then transformed the data into a format that could be easily processed by the machine learning algorithms. This included converting categorical variables into numerical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## Machine Learning Model Development
After completing the data preprocessing step, I began developing the machine learning model. I explored different algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to determine which would be most suitable for this problem. I also experimented with different hyperparameters to optimize the performance of the model.

## Future Steps
Moving forward, my plan is to continue refining the machine learning model by testing additional algorithms and tuning hyperparameters to improve its accuracy. I will also work on developing a web-based application or API that incorporates the model to enable real-time fraud detection in the healthcare industry.

## Technologies
The technologies that I am using for this step of the project include Python, Scikit-Learn, and Pandas.
