# Report for Step 1 of Machine Learning-powered Fraud Detection System for Healthcare

## Overview
For Step 1 of the project, I focused on gathering data related to insurance fraud in the healthcare industry. I decided to start with this step as it's important to have a good understanding of the data before proceeding with any further development.

## Data Gathering
As part of my research, I analyzed various sources such as industry reports, academic papers, and online databases. I was able to identify some key characteristics and patterns that are commonly associated with insurance fraud in healthcare. I also studied the different types of fraud schemes that are prevalent in the industry.

## Learning Focus
Although I have some knowledge of machine learning, I decided to focus on data gathering and analysis first, as it's important to have a solid foundation before proceeding with more advanced techniques. Therefore, I'm using this opportunity to enhance my data processing and analysis skills, particularly in Python and Pandas.

## Future Steps
Moving forward, my plan is to continue exploring different data sources and gathering additional data on insurance fraud in healthcare. I will also work on cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure that it's suitable for analysis.

## Technologies
The technologies that I will be primarily using for this project are Python and Pandas.


## Report for Step 1 of Machine Learning Object Recognition System for Healthcare

### Overview
For Step 1 of the project, I focused on determining the medical instruments and equipment to focus on for the object recognition system. This step is crucial as it helps in selecting the appropriate instruments and equipment to train the system.

### Data Gathering
As part of my research, I analyzed various sources such as medical equipment catalogs, industry reports, and academic papers. I identified common medical instruments and equipment used in hospital settings, such as scalpels, forceps, syringes, and stethoscopes.

### Learning Focus
Although I have some knowledge of machine learning, I decided to focus on data gathering and analysis first, as it's important to have a solid foundation before proceeding with more advanced techniques. Therefore, I'm using this opportunity to enhance my research and data collection skills, as well as to learn in a deeper way the technologies involved, such as TensorFlow for machine learning model development and possibly OpenCV for computer vision tasks.

### Future Steps
Moving forward, my plan is to collect and label a dataset of images of the identified medical instruments and equipment. I will also work on cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure that it's suitable for training the machine learning model.

### Technologies
The technologies that I will be primarily using for this project are Python and TensorFlow for the machine learning model development, and possibly OpenCV for computer vision tasks.
